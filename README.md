# EquipmentAutomation

This repository includes different automation programs.

The first one: WLR.py (White Light Reflectivity) allows to control a Standa  stage with two independent rotating arms to perform reflectivity measurements for different polar and azimuthal angles (The sample's direction being also controlled by a separate part of the program). WLR.py can automate Lightfield by Teledyne (Princeton Instruments) in order to perform and record the measurements using a HRS 500 and a Pylon-2KB CCD. Threading is handled by PyQT5

The second one: ARPL.py (Angle Resolved PhotoLuminescence) enables photoluminescence measurements at different angles relying on an NKT Supercontinuum laser automatded in python.

The third one: OneO.py is a program designed to perform scanning and mapping of samples in microphotoluminescence using a nanopositioning stage by piezoconcept.

Finally, Extreme.py is a standalone version with a GUI for the use of Supercontinuum NKT laser and its blue/UV extension.
